Add Turborepo to your existing project
Turborepo can be used in any project to speed up the execution of scripts in your package.json.
After you install turbo, you'll be able to run all your package.json tasks from turbo instead of your package manager.
By configuring your turbo.json correctly, you'll notice how caching helps your tasks run a lot faster.
Quickstart
If you don't have one already, create a new application:
Next.js
Vite
npx create-next-app@latest


Install turbo globally:
npm
yarn
pnpm
yarn global add turbo


For more details about installation, see Installing Turborepo
Add a turbo.json file at the base of your new repository:
For more information on configuring your turbo.json, see the Configuration Options documentation.
Next.js
Vite
turbo.json
{
  "$schema": "https://turbo.build/schema.json",
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "outputs": [".next/**", "!.next/cache/**"]
    },
    "lint": {}
  }
}


Edit .gitignore
Add .turbo to your .gitignore file. The CLI uses these folders for logs and certain task outputs.
+ .turbo


Try running build and lint with turbo:
turbo build lint


This runs build and lint at the same time.
Without making any changes to the code, try running build and lint again:
turbo build lint


You should see terminal output like this:
 Tasks:    2 successful, 2 total
Cached:    2 cached, 2 total
  Time:    185ms >>> FULL TURBO


Congratulations - you just completed a build and lint in under 200ms.

Try running dev with turbo:
turbo dev


You'll notice that your dev script starts up. You can use turbo to run any script in your package.json
